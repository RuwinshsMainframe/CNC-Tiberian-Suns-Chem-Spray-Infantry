# Reimplementing Chem Spray Infantry in Command & Conquer: Tiberian Sun
### By downloading the files from this repository and adding them to Tiberian Sun's game folder you can reimplement this forgotten unit. The unit's sprites are from the game files, however, its weapon and weapon sprites were custom made by me since there is no unused weapon for it.

## Instructions

1. Download this repository.
2. Extract the contents from the .zip file and copy its contents.
3. Find your Tiberian Sun game folder and paste the copied files into it.  

   If you're using the Steam version of Tiberian Sun, you can find the game folder in your Steam library by right-clicking the game's name, then going to Properties -> Installed Files -> Browse.

   If you're using the free version of Tiberian Sun, the game folder is most likely located on your C: drive under Westwood -> SUN.

4. Boot up the game.
